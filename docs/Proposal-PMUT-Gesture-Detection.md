# Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (PMUT) for Hand Gesture Recognition 


## Project Description



Skills Needed

Deliverables

There are a number of example project proposals uploaded to course site on the main page. You can look at these for inspiration.


### Concerns
- Machine learning on time series data frames. (Sliding window ?)
- Supervised learning, where do we get the training data?
- What's the advantage over using computer vision and just running ML on that instead?
  - Less dimmensionality? Research fidelity of PMUT.
