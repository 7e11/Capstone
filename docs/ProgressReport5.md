# Progress Report 5

## Summary of Work Completed

Preliminary looking into datasets and OpenCV. There have been some good discussions about possible ways to combine serveral datasets which have different input and output formats. Felix is currently doing research on different transofrmations you can make on the input data in order to make it easier to train on, like FFT and edge detection.

### Goals completed this week

We had several discussions about the project, and I think we're in a better place than last week. As mentioned, we did not attempt the OpenCV part yet.

### Goals not met this week

We ended up not pursuing OpenCV just yet. We've realized that the machine learning portion of this project is the most important part, so we're focusing on finding papers and datasets which we can delve into.

### Challenges faced this week

None

### Goals for next week

Over spring break we're not going to be working except for some of the softer stuff. Currently, we have a few papers and datasets we'd like to look into more.

- [IBM datset](http://www.research.ibm.com/dvsgesture/)
  - More of a full body dataset. Includes video from the waist up.
- [**Ego Gesture Dataset**](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/iva/yfzhang/datasets/egogesture.html)
  - Seems extremely promising. Several interesting gestures and motions are included. Explore this one futher, and make sure to read the paper.
- [TBN Dataset](https://medium.com/twentybn/gesture-recognition-using-end-to-end-learning-from-a-large-video-database-2ecbfb4659ff)
  - Only have done preliminary research into this. Unsure as to it's viability
- [Gesture recognition toolkit](https://github.com/nickgillian/grt)
  - Likely unusable. Has a fancy name but seems quite out of date.
