# Progress Report 4

2020.2.23 - 2020.2.29

## Summary of Work Completed

Completed presentation, downloaded OpenCV to investigate its gesture recognition capabilities.
Started searching for a dataset which is appropriate for this project. IBM has one, so do OpenCV and Kaggle.

### Goals completed this week

Our Checkpoint 1 presentation went very well. We still don't know if our project is approved, but we're going to continue working on it.

### Goals not met this week

None

### Challenges faced this week

We had to meet twice outside class to flesh out our presentation and to practice it.

### Goals for next week

Get OpenCV running for everyone. Have preliminary motion regocnition completed.

## Individual Member Contributions

For each group member, list the individual contributions, and a link to proof in the form of a commit to your group repository. At the end, provide an estimate for how many hours these contributions took to complete.

### Evan Hruskar

- Found IBM and OpenCV datasets [proof](http://www.research.ibm.com/dvsgesture/) 
- Contribution 2 [proof](link) 
- Contribution 3 [proof](link)

Estimated time allocated this week: 3 Hrs

### Felix Quintana

- Discussed with group on why we need to switch from ultrasonic device to a cnn for now for proof of concept. I researched some ideas on where we should start. For example, leap motion direction? But we eventually found to do something with auto hot heys
Estimated time allocated this week: X Hrs

### Jitong Ding

- Search and study the OpenCv [proof](https://opencv.org/)
