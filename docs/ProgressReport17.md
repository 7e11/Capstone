# Progress Report 17

## Summary of Work Completed

This week we all got our schedules coordinated so we can have weekly meetings. One of our teammates are based in China currently so we made a schedule to work with that. Felix set up a trello with boards so the team can track our progress.

We also decided to pivot the goal of the project to be more aligned with current world events specifically attacking hygene on touch screen monitors. We suggest providing basic gestures with an intuitive UI to interact with screens for customers such as kiosks. We plan to discuss this futher with our mentor in our upcomming meeting.
