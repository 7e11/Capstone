# Progress Report 3

2020.2.16 - 2020.2.22

## Summary of Work Completed

We've decied on a group name: jestr. Read more papers, did more research into PMUT tech.
Decided that it may be better to transition into camera gesture recognition, so we can focus on the applications
rather than the tech itself.

### Goals completed this week

One goal for this week was to get funded for the PMUT project. Unfortunately, it looks like using ultrasound will
be a little over our heads, so we've decided to transition into using camera recognition for gesture control.

### Goals not met this week

None

### Challenges faced this week

Deciding to shift the technology which is going to underly the entire project is no easy decision.
However, now that we're more solidified in our direction, we're feeling confident about the future of the project.

### Goals for next week

Create a presentation about our project to show to the class. Do more research.

## Individual Member Contributions

For each group member, list the individual contributions, and a link to proof in the form of a commit to your group repository. At the end, provide an estimate for how many hours these contributions took to complete.

### Felix Quintana

Buckled down and found out about the difficulties that we would face with using the ultrasounic approach. More importantly, we need several MHz to detect tendons which is not plausible with the given proposal. So we need to change dirrection. Trying to figure out if there are other sensors we can use.
