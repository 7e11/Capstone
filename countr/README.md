## Project Description:
	UserA navigates to the UserA website. He is greeted with a home screen that gives him the option to “Log In” or “Register” for an account. UserA is new to Countr, so he chooses “Register”, which directs him to a form. He fills out the username and password he wants, then enters the starting value for his first counter as 123. After clicking “Submit”, UserA is directed to a website containing the following elements:
		1. A header with the name of the user
		2. A counter, consisting of:
			a. Text indicating the value UserA entered as his initial counter value.
			b. Two buttons, one that when clicked increments the counter by one; the other that when clicked decrements the counter by 	one. When either of these buttons are clicked, the value of the text is updated to reflect the new counter value stored in memory.
			c. A “remove” button, which will remove the counter from the user’s account when clicked.
			d. A “share” button, which will generate and display a link that will allow a recipient to see the value of the associated counter.
		3. A “New Counter” button which when clicked will prompt the user to enter a value, and a new counter will be created with that number as an initial value.
		4. A “Logout” button, which will redirect UserA to the home screen when clicked.
	UserA clicks “new” and enters the value 456. A new counter is created under the 123 counter. He clicks the “Share” button next to the new counter. A link is generated: “countrbook.com/2a7e84fb”. UserA sends this link to UserB. UserB receives the link from UserA. When she follows the link in her browser, the body of the HTML she receives back is just the value 456.
